'Perl' is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic
programming languages. The languages in this family include Perl 5 and Perl
6.<ref></ref>

Though Perl is not officially an acronym,<ref></ref> there are various
backronyms in use, the most well-known being "Practical Extraction and
Reporting Language".<ref></ref> Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in
1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing
easier.<ref name='sheppard00'></ref> Since then, it has undergone many changes
and revisions. Perl 6, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually
evolved into a separate language. Both languages continue to be developed
independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from
one another.

The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C,
shell script (sh), AWK, and sed.<ref name="perltimeline"></ref> They provide
powerful text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of
many contemporary Unix commandline tools,<ref name="programmingperl"></ref>
facilitating easy manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread
popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its
unsurpassed<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> regular expression and string
parsing abilities.<ref name='roderick02'></ref>

In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for graphics programming, system
administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other
applications. It has been nicknamed "the Swiss Army chainsaw <!-- Note to
editors. This should read *chainsaw*, not knife. Check the ref -->of scripting
languages" because of its flexibility and power,<ref></ref> and possibly also
because of its "ugliness".<ref></ref> In 1998, it was also referred to as the
"duct tape that holds the Internet together", in reference to both its
ubiquitous use as a glue language and its perceived inelegance.<ref

This is my answer: 'Perl' is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages.

 the north bank of the Thames, London, England]] An 'apartment' (in American and
 Canadian English) or a 'flat' (in British English) is a self-contained housing
 unit (a type of residential real estate) that occupies only part of a building,
 correctly, on a single level without a stair. Such a building may be called an
 apartment building, apartment complex, apartment house (in American English),
 block of flats, [[tower block]], high-rise or, occasionally mansion block (in
 British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for rent. In
 Scotland it is called a block of flats or, if it's a traditional sandstone
 building, a tenement, which has a pejorative connotation elsewhere. Apartments
 may be owned by an owner/occupier, by leasehold tenure or rented by tenants
 (two types of housing tenure).
